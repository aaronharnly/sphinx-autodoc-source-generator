This script will traverse a tree of Python modules and create sphinx RST
source (using the autodoc extension) that reflects the tree.

Usage: sphinx-autodoc-sourcegen.py [options] <package path> [exclude paths, ...]

Note: By default this script will not overwrite already created files.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n HEADER, --doc-header=HEADER
                        Documentation Header (default=Project)
  -d DESTDIR, --dest-dir=DESTDIR
                        Output destination directory
  -s SUFFIX, --suffix=SUFFIX
                        module suffix (default=txt)
  -m MAXDEPTH, --maxdepth=MAXDEPTH
                        Maximum depth of submodules to show in the TOC
                        (default=4)
  -r, --dry-run         Run the script without creating the files
  -f, --force           Overwrite all the files
  -t, --no-toc          Don't create the table of content file
  -1, --one-module      Store only one module per file


This code was refactored by Robin Keller, rkeller@cars.com. The -1 option
was added to allow the script to only generate one module per file.
